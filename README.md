# Simple Gym Beta

<kbd>![Image](project.png)</kbd>

An extremely simple workout "app" to provide upper or lower body workout plans. Made in record time solely to get me to the gym without having to think about what to exercise beforehand.

Built off of an existing project with a simple [gulp framework I made](https://github.com/DanBuda11/gulp-framework) that compiles Sass to CSS, and minifies everything.
